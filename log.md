# 100 Days Of Code - Log

    

<p>
<h5> Day 1 - 3.24.21 </h5>
 I created an account on <a href="http://freecodingcamp.org"> Free Coding Camp</a> and started on the Responsive Web Design Certification and completed the basic HTML & HTML5 challenges in about an hour and a half. It feels like I am not sure yet what's going on but after over 10 years since I last wrote any code, it feels good to be at it again. 
  </p>

<h5> Day 2 - 3.25.21</h5>
<p> Completed the Basic CSS module and although it feels good to be grasping some basic concepts, I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface of HTML and CSS. Just ordered a book on HTML and CSS to start diggin deeper. I'm determined to make this more about quality and depth of understanding than just surface knowledge of a lot. 
  </p>
  <p>
<h5> Day 3 - 3.26.21</h5>
 After completing the Basic HTML and CSS modules of FCC, I realise I need to go deeper so I'm back tracking to a video course on HTML and CSS with the aim of going deeper and fully grasping the concepts and useful items. Learned about MDN and devdocs today and I believe those might be quite useful alongside everything else.  
</p>

<p>
    <h5> Day 4 - 3.27.21</h5>
    Choosing to dive deeper into HTML and CSS is proving to be the right choice not necessarily because of the knowledge gained but more for the confidence it's adding to me. Today, I managed to write a replica of my photography page using HTML and CSS. I'm learning how to find solutions to the (basic, I'm sure) problems I've encountered so far.  
    </p> 
    <p>
    <h5> Day 5 - 3.28.21</h5>
    Further practice in CSS with FCC and the methodology of it is beginning to sink in slowly. It's beginning to feel like what I need to learn is
    how to think and if I can do that, the job would be finding the code to help me accomplish my thoughts.
    </p>

<p>
    <h5>Day 6 3.29.21 </h5>
    It's been an incredibly busy day at work that will carry late into the night but I brought my HTML & CSS book with me and have managed to get some study in and write some code during while waiting for files to load and during my lunch break. <br>
    Ended up putting in additional 3 hours of coding practice after work. I'm realising that this might become all-consuming quite soon.  
</p>

<p>
   <h5>Day 7 3.30.21 </h5>
   The more I learn, the more I realise how much I don't know. I'm finding myself light on the basic fundamentals of computer engineering so i enrolled in the Edx CS50 course for an overview. The intention is to power through that as quickly as possible to put pins on things that will require more attention. Racked up a another 3-4 hrs of coding today. Jeanine's resume website is coming together.
   </p>

   <h5>Day 8 3.31.21 </h5>
   Still going through the FCC classes and just discovered frontendmentor challenges. I worked on my first design challeng using CSS and beginning to get a hang of using stack overflow when I'm stuck. I think these challenges might be helpful to give me targets to practice with as I soak up the courses. 
   </p>

   <h5>Day 9 4.1.21 </h5>
  Trudging along. The depth of what I still don't know if I need to know is weighing on me. This feels like a good time to focus on the trees and leave the forest be but I don't know how well I can do that. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
   <h5>Day 10 4.2.21 </h5>
   Still putting in the hours. Making progress.

<h5> Day 1 - 3.24.21 </h5>
<p> I opened an account on <a href="http://freecodingcamp.org"> Free Coding Camp</a> and started on the Responsive Web Design Certification and completeing the basic HTML & HTML5 challenges in about an hour and a half. It feels like I am not sure yet what's going on but after over 10 years since I last wrote any code, it feels good to be at it again.

<div class="spruced-text" ><h5> Day 2 - 3.25.21</h5>
<p class="bg"> Completed the Basic CSS module and although it feels good to be grasping some basic concepts, I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface of HTML and CSS. Just ordered a book on HTML and CSS to start diggin deeper. I'm determined to make this more about quality and depth of understanding than just surface knowledge of a lot.

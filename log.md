# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<h5> Day 1 - 3.24.21 </h5>
<p> I opened an account on <a href="http://freecodingcamp.org"> Free Coding Camp</a> and started on the Responsive Web Design Certification and completeing the basic HTML & HTML5 challenges in about an hour and a half. It feels like I am not sure yet what's going on but after over 10 years since I last wrote any code, it feels good to be at it again.

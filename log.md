# 100 Days Of Code - Log

    


<h5> Day 1 - 3.24.21 </h5>
<p> I opened an account on <a href="http://freecodingcamp.org"> Free Coding Camp</a> and started on the Responsive Web Design Certification and completed the basic HTML & HTML5 challenges in about an hour and a half. It feels like I am not sure yet what's going on but after over 10 years since I last wrote any code, it feels good to be at it again.

<h5> Day 2 - 3.25.21</h5>
<p> Completed the Basic CSS module and although it feels good to be grasping some basic concepts, I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface of HTML and CSS. Just ordered a book on HTML and CSS to start diggin deeper. I'm determined to make this more about quality and depth of understanding than just surface knowledge of a lot.

  <h5> Day 3 3.26.21</h5>
 After completing the Basic HTML and CSS modules of FCC, I realise I need to go deeper so I'm back tracking to a video course on HTML and CSS with the aim of going deeper and fully grasping the concepts and useful items. Learned about MDN and devdocs today and I believe those might be quite useful alongside everything else.
